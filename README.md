## Why This Exists

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is one of the most important inventions in the history of medical research. Born from the ashes of the Nuremberg Trials (1947) and codified through the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and the Belmont Report (1979), the IRB exists to ensure that no human being is subjected to research without informed consent, proper risk assessment, and ethical oversight. These are non-negotiable principles. The horrors of Tuskegee, Unit 731, and countless other episodes of unchecked medical experimentation remind us why.

**But somewhere along the way, the bureaucracy ate the mission.**

What was meant to protect human subjects has calcified into a paperwork marathon. At [KFSYSCC](https://www.kfsyscc.org/human/common_files/1) alone, researchers must navigate **11 submission categories** and **43+ forms** — each with its own version number, formatting requirements, and checkbox conventions. A single retrospective chart review (minimal risk, no patient contact, de-identified data) requires 5 forms. A clinical trial? Double that. An amendment to fix a typo in your protocol? Another 4 forms.

The researcher's time is finite. Every hour spent copying IRB numbers into the header of form SF037 is an hour not spent analyzing data, writing manuscripts, or — most importantly — caring for patients. The forms themselves are not the problem. The problem is that filling them out is **mindless, repetitive, error-prone labor** that a machine should do.

This project does not bypass the IRB. It does not skip ethical review. It does not auto-approve anything. It simply fills in the forms that the IRB requires, using the data you provide, so you can focus on the parts that actually require human judgment: study design, risk assessment, and the protection of your participants.

> "The ethics of research is in the design, not the paperwork."

**IRB-in-Hurry: because your time is better spent on science.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/htlin222/irb-in-hurry.git
cd irb-in-hurry
make setup

# 2. Edit config.yml with your study details
#    (or copy the example fixture)
cp tests/fixtures/sample_retrospective.yml config.yml

# 3. Generate everything
make all
```

## Usage

### Makefile Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make all` | Generate DOCX + PDF + dashboard |
| `make generate` | Generate DOCX forms only |
| `make pdf` | Convert DOCX to PDF + PNG previews |
| `make dashboard` | Show submission status |
| `make checklist` | View ■/□ checklist |
| `make test` | Run pytest |
| `make clean` | Remove generated files |
| `make new` | Switch to new case phase + generate |
| `make closure` | Switch to closure phase + generate |
| `make amendment` | Switch to amendment phase + generate |
| `make continuing` | Switch to continuing review + generate |

### Workflow

```
config.yml → generate_all.py → output/*.docx → convert.py → output/*.pdf
                                                           → output/preview/*.png
                                  checklist.md ← checklist.py
```

1. **Edit `config.yml`** — Fill in study metadata (IRB number, titles, PI info, dates, study type)
2. **`make all`** — Generates DOCX forms, converts to PDF, shows dashboard
3. **Review previews** — Check `output/preview/*.png` for visual validation
4. **Complete manual steps** — Sign forms, attach protocol, email to irb@kfsyscc.org

## Testing

```bash
make test
```

15 tests covering form selection logic, DOCX content verification, checklist generation, and end-to-end generation for both new case and closure phases.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/) — DOCX generation
- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) — Config parsing
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) — DOCX→PDF conversion (`brew install --cask libreoffice`)
- [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) — PDF→PNG preview (`brew install poppler`)

## Claude Code Integration

This project includes a [Claude Code skill](.claude/skills/irb/SKILL.md) that enables AI-assisted IRB form preparation. When using Claude Code in this repo, it can:

- Classify your study type from a proposal description
- Auto-fill `config.yml` based on your study details
- Generate and validate all required forms
- Guide you through manual steps

## GitHub Copilot Integration

This repo now also includes GitHub Copilot-specific setup:

- [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) gives Copilot the same repo-specific workflow constraints as Claude
- [`.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`](.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml) preinstalls `uv` and syncs dependencies for Copilot cloud agent sessions

## Workflow Hooks and Asset Aware MCP

Optional hooks let you enforce each document-processing stage from `config.yml`:

- `before_generate`, `before_form_generate`, `after_form_generate`, `after_generate`
- `before_convert`, `before_docx_to_pdf`, `after_docx_to_pdf`, `before_pdf_to_png`, `after_pdf_to_png`, `after_convert`

Each hook accepts one or more commands and receives placeholders such as `{config_path}`, `{output_dir}`, `{input_path}`, `{output_path}`, `{phase}`, and `{irb_no}`.

To route DOCX→PDF conversion through [u9401066/asset-aware-mcp](https://github.com/u9401066/asset-aware-mcp), set:

```yaml
automation:
  conversion:
    backend: asset_aware_mcp
    command: "your asset-aware-mcp command using {input_path} and {output_path}"
```

When `backend` is left as `libreoffice`, the existing LibreOffice conversion path is used unchanged.
